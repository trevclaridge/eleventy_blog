## Use Case

[In the post before this one](../Using_GitHub_To_Host_My_TTRPG_Design_Project), I talked a bit about my process and reasoning in migrating my notes on my current game design project to GitHub. This comes with a variety of benefits, one of which led me down a rabbit hole that, admittedly, shaved a few years off my life.

One of the main problems I foresaw with my migrating all my game notes to GitHub is that sharing the *whole* game with folks would be a cumbersome. It's easy enough for me to link people my repo, but the repo is a complex tree of markdown files that is difficult to parse through. I like to have my writing fairly silo'd, with each mechanic having its own markdown file. This just helps me mentally separate out the logical pieces, as well as making it easier to see changes in the git diff viewer. There is no logical "beginning" for where to begin reading; of course, I could put a note to that effect in the README and direct readers' eyes towards the relevant directories, but that is a lot to ask of someone already being very generous investing time in reading a *draft* of a game. So, I resolved to make that process easier by finding a way to join all of my various markdown files into a single PDF, via an automated process in a GitHub action.

## Failed Attempts

This turned out to be a 2 days-long problem, with many a failed endeavor. I think I landed somewhere in the realm of 100 unique commits, just trying to find the right magic spell to get the action to do what I wanted. But, we try and try again, and I'm happy to say I found a solution that I'm really happy with.

For those who might find this post in their attempts in the future, however, I'll just mention the couple of GitHub actions that I tried to use, but ultimately gave up on.

### [Markdown-to-PDF](https://github.com/BaileyJM02/markdown-to-pdf)

This was a promising lead because other GitHub actions linked to it after being deprecated. It also supports styling with CSS, which was a big deal for me (more on that later).

If I'm remembering correctly, my big issue with this option was that I couldn't specify an ordering to the markdown files; the only options were path-to-specific-file or path-to-directory-with-files. For my project, I really need my pdf to join the markdown files in a specific sequence, or mechanics and explanations of rules could wind up mixed in with other non-relevant information, leading to confusion. And, thus I moved on to find another tool.

### [Publish-Markdown-As-PDF](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/publish-markdown-as-pdf)

This is one of the actions that linked to Markdown-to-PDF. Right away, I noticed that the `sources` argument available in this action gave a list of individual document sources. Along with a number of other features, this action seemed to allow the specification of an order in which to stitch the inputs, awesome!

The problem for this action was, unfortunately, that it had a lot of trouble recognizing the sources I specified!

![A meme of Captain Picard from Star Trek facepalming.](picard-meme-facepalm.webp)

To be honest, this was mostly my fault, as I've been naming my directories and files with spaces included (I like the way it looks ðŸ¤·). This action didn't seem to understand what I wanted to include, regardless of quotes or formatting. So, we move on again.

## Solution: Pandoc

Enter the tool that makes this all possible. [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/) is super powerful command-line tool that can convert files between a *huge* list of supported file types. I mean, just look at this visualizer of the possible permutations they have on their website:

![A large node-graph showing all of the possible conversions available in Pandoc.](pandoc-file-conversions.png)

For our purposes, we are mostly interested in markdown to pdf, but you may also find value in its capabilities concerning markdown to html, or docx, or epub, or a slew of Wiki markup formats.

Pandoc also allows for specifying the ordering of file inputs, hooray!

There is a popular [Pandoc GitHub Action](https://github.com/pandoc/pandoc-action-example), which provides a number of docker containers for which to run Pandoc. I ran the gambit of the available docker containers in my efforts, but, for reasons I'll explain in a bit, I actually had to switch to a community docker that was built off the "official" containers.

First things first, though, if your use case if fairly simple, perhaps you only need to convert one document to something like html, you can probably just follow the documentation in the README of the action to get going, it's a surprising simple tool. In terms of getting to know how to use Pandoc, I also recommend these few of YouTube tutorials I watched from [chantastic](https://youtu.be/bHMIL822NVs?si=rapsK928z-S7nMdL), [The Mouseless Dev](https://youtu.be/-S8-a_YS6tc?si=xB01uh4WyPst0BmO), [Brodie Robertson](https://youtu.be/lMIlNsi3eAY?si=ERfOZCKAAyHE6ZEv).

### Using Pandoc

The first thing that the documentation of the GitHub Action mentions is that, if you are trying to convert anything to PDF, you will want to use their LaTeX docker container, `pandoc/latex`. Pandoc uses LaTeX to create PDF documents, and this container includes LaTeX as well as a few common LaTeX packages. **Do not be deceived!** In my struggles, I found it was much easier to use the `pandoc/extra` container, which includes a whole bunch more LaTeX packages, one of which allowed me to have bullet point lists with indention levels more than 6 levels deep, [see here for the code that I used](https://github.com/jgm/pandoc/issues/2922#issuecomment-360201454). *Note: I end up switching off of the `pandoc/extra` container later on.*

With just a few changes, this action got me 80% of the way to my goal. It was the final 20% that drained my soul. Here are the major issues that I ran into:

#### External list for the file order

This one took about 7 years off my life, give or take a year.

I was so sure that this was going to be an easy little enhancement I could add in to make my yaml file a little cleaner. No. Wrong. I'll spare all details of all my failed attempts, but in the end I finally have an good 'ole [txt file at the root of my repo](https://github.com/trevclaridge/Writ-of-Rulers/blob/main/file_order.txt) that lists all of the file paths to the markdown files I want and in the order I want. See the "Get File Order" part of the workflow file below.

The trick uses two key parts:

1. The contents of the file is `cat`-ed out during the run. What was hardest here was ensuring that the multi-line contents, the paths to each markdown file, are formatted in a way that Pandoc will understand as an input. This means removing the newlines and carriage returns from the output during the `cat` using the `tr` command as a filter, and replacing those characters with spaces. `| tr '\r\n' ' '`
2. The output of the entire run step (the file paths separated by spaces) is stored in a variable that is added to the `GITHUB_OUTPUT` environment variable so it can be referenced later. Remember to add an id to your run step so that this output can be used later (see mine, `get_file_order`, right after the step name).

#### Additional Unicode Symbols

I'd say, 8 or 9 years for this one. Turns out, LaTeX really sucks!. I mean, it's great, but it sucks.

The following glyph caused hours of frustration for me:

â‡”

Observe it and despair.

So, if I'm understanding this correctly (which, it is entirely possible that I'm not), this was a problem of the font used by LaTeX to generate the pdf text--that the specific font didn't have the glyph for the that double arrow character. This caused warnings in the build process, but LaTeX still generates the file, just without the characters it doesn't know. This resulted in a few blank spaces in the document, which wouldn't have been the end of the world, but at this point I was thinking, "I'm *this* close to 100%," so I went through the trouble of trying to add the character to the unicode set that LaTeX was using. Advice online was to just the `newunicodechar` LaTeX package, which I attempted.

Unfortunately, neither the `pandoc/latex` or `pandoc/extra` docker containers have this package included. I went down the rabbit hole of trying to add the package the containers (still don't know how to do this, and would like to learn), as well as trying to install Pandoc and related packages directly into the GitHub runner.

This whole process was really starting to get to me, and I have to admit to giving up briefly around this time. I never actually solved this issue in the way that I wanted; that becomes irrelevant later, though, to wondrous cause.

#### CSS styling

Pandoc allows "intermediate" steps to be used when converted file formats to other formats. I'm not knowledgeable of all the options available, but at least for PDF, you can specify an HTML intermediate step so that you can add a css argument to style the ultimate pdf output. [The official Pandoc documentation on this can be found here.](https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#:~:text=You%20can%20control%20the%20PDF%20style%20using%20variables%2C%20depending%20on%20the%20intermediate%20format%20used)

Thankfully, this is the step that actually saved this whole project for me. In trying to find the right combination of pdf engine and arguments to get this to work, I again ran into the issue of trying to install additional packages to the docker container. I was trying to install [WeasyPrint](https://weasyprint.org/) to use as a pdf engine, as other pdf engines were complaining that they were not compatible with HTML. This lead me to the `fpod/pandoc-weasyprint` docker container, [found here](https://hub.docker.com/r/fpod/pandoc-weasyprint). As the description intimates, this is a container built off the `pandoc/latex` image with WeasyPrint installed, as well as a few extras.

So, I changed the docker image used in the GitHub action to this new container, and **everything just worked**.

Pandoc allows for the `--css` argument, which just looks for a CSS file to use for styling (`--css="styles.css"`). Importantly, you also need ensure that your output filetype is html (`--to=html`), but your output filename ends with .pdf (`--output="output_file.pdf"`). You will also want to ensure that Pandoc tries to use WeasyPrint to generate your pdf (`--pdf-engine=weasyprint`).

The default styling on my first successful run actually came out very pretty! I'm not clear if that is base WeasyPrint or if the docker container has a default css file defined. The only things I currently have changed on top of the default styling is a slight increase to the line height of paragraph and list item elements.

*And! This new setup even fixed the unicode character issues I was having before!*

### Pandoc End

In the end, I'm totally happy with the output I've achieved with the current action. I may come back later and style the pdf even more, ya know, give it some color and generally ritz it up, but for now I'm happy with the results. Now we just need to upload that pdf document in a way that makes it easy to access.

## Upload and Release Artifacts

These two steps are luckily pretty much standard fare. You actually likely don't even need both, as either will allow you to download the output pdf, just in slightly different ways. If you're going to choose between the two, I'd recommend the Upload PDF as Release step, as that allows downloading the pdf directly, instead of compressed in a zip archive.

The only issue I ran into at this stage was ensuring that there was a unique "tag" for each release. To make things simple, I'm just using the run number provided by the GitHub runner which is just a number that ticks up for each run. I'm also appending this number to the file name and release name so that it is easier to identify different versions of the file. You may want to make this tag construction more nuanced, perhaps with semantic versioning, but just using the run number works for me for now. Finally, I add the `makeLatest` flag to the most recent run; again probably not necessary with a fancier versioning system, but works for simple use.

A new release is generated on each run per this workflow, though you could specify more specific releases in the `on` argument at the beginning of the workflow file.

[This link automatically redirects to the most recent version of the final output file](https://github.com/trevclaridge/Writ-of-Rulers/releases/latest). You can achieve this by adding "/releases/latest" to your GitHub repo's url once everything is set up.
